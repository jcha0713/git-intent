**git-intent** is a Git workflow tool designed for creating [intentional commits](https://intentionalcommits.org/).

### Why git-intent?

Most developers write code first and craft commit messages as an afterthought. This practice often leads to large, unclear, and unfocused commits. Inspired by the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, git-intent encourages defining clear intentions before you begin coding, transforming your commit process into a proactive part of development.


By focusing on your intentions upfront, git-intent enables you to:
- Maintain a clean, easily navigable commit history
- Clearly communicate your development intentions
- Prevent scope creep and maintain atomic changes
- Enhance collaboration and project maintainability

## FAQ

**Q: Why define intentions before coding?**  
A: Clearly defined intentions help you stay focused, create more meaningful commits, and improve collaboration and readability of commit history.

**Q: Where are my intentions stored? Are they shared or committed to Git?**  
A: Intentions are stored locally in your repository's `.git` directory and are not shared or committed. They remain private unless explicitly shared.
