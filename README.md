## Usage

Git Intent is a Git workflow tool for intentional commits. Plan your commits before coding to write more meaningful and purposeful code.

```bash
# Add multiple intentions
git intent add "feat: implement login page"
git intent add "feat: add password validation"
git intent add "feat: implement session management"

# Alternatively, omit the message to open your editor:
git intent add

# List all intentions
git intent list

# Start working on a specific intention
git intent start <intention-id>

# Alternatively, omit the ID to select interactively:
git intent start

# Show current intention
git intent show

# Complete current intention and commit
git intent commit

# You can also append an additional message:
git intent commit -m "Add tests and fix edge case"

# Cancel current intention
git intent cancel

# Reset all intentions
git intent reset

# Divide an intention into smaller parts
git intent divide <intention-id>

# Alternatively, omit the ID to select interactively and open the editor:
git intent divide

# Drop a specific intention
git intent drop <intention-id>
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why define intentions before coding?**  
A: It helps you stay focused and write more purposeful commits. It also improves collaboration and commit history readability.

**Q: Where are my intentions stored? Are they shared or committed to Git?**  
A: All intentions are stored locally inside your repositoryâ€™s `.git` directory and are not committed to version control. Each project maintains its own separate intentions. They are private to your local setup unless you explicitly share them.
